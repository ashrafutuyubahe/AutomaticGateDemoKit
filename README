# 🚪 Automatic Gate Demo Kit

This project demonstrates an **Arduino-based automatic gate system** that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby objects. When an object (e.g., a person or car) is detected within a set distance, the gate opens using a servo motor and provides visual (LEDs) and audible (buzzer) feedback. After a timeout period, the gate automatically closes.

## 📦 Features

- 🔊 **Ultrasonic distance sensing** to detect approaching objects
- ⚙️ **Servo motor** to open and close the gate
- 🔴🔵 **Red and Blue LEDs** to indicate gate status
- 🔔 **Buzzer** that beeps while the gate is open
- ⏳ Automatic closing after a configurable timeout (5 seconds)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔌 Step 1: Circuit Setup

- Assemble your circuit according to the **Pin Configuration** above.
- Use resistors for LEDs and connect cathodes to ground.

### 💻 Step 2: Upload Code to Arduino

1. Open the `.ino` sketch file (the provided Arduino code) in the **Arduino IDE**.
2. Select your Arduino board and port:
   - **Tools → Board → Arduino Uno** (or your board)
   - **Tools → Port → [Your COM Port]**
3. Click **Upload** (right arrow button).

### 🧪 Step 3: Test It

- Power your Arduino using USB or an external power source.
- Place an object within 50 cm in front of the ultrasonic sensor.
- The gate (servo) should open, red LED should turn OFF, blue LED turns ON, and the buzzer starts beeping softly.
- When the object is removed, after 5 seconds the gate closes and indicators reset.

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Object Detection:** Uses `pulseIn()` with the HC-SR04 sensor to measure distance.
- **Gate Control:** A servo motor opens/closes the gate when an object is within range.
- **LEDs:** Red = Closed, Blue = Open.
- **Buzzer:** Emits short periodic beeps while the gate is open.
- **Auto-Close:** After 5 seconds of no detection, the gate closes.
