# 🚪 Automatic Gate Demo Kit

This project demonstrates an **Arduino-based automatic gate system** that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby objects. When an object (e.g., a person or car) is detected within a set distance, the gate opens using a servo motor and provides visual (LEDs) and audible (buzzer) feedback. After a timeout period, the gate automatically closes.

## 📦 Features

- 🔊 **Ultrasonic distance sensing** to detect approaching objects
- ⚙️ **Servo motor** to open and close the gate
- 🔴🔵 **Red and Blue LEDs** to indicate gate status
- 🔔 **Buzzer** that beeps while the gate is open
- ⏳ Automatic closing after a configurable timeout

## 🔧 Hardware Required

- Arduino (Uno, Nano, or compatible board)
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo motor (e.g., SG90)
- Red LED
- Blue LED
- Resistors (for LEDs)
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires and breadboard

## 🧠 Working Principle

1. **Object Detection:** The ultrasonic sensor continuously checks the distance to nearby objects.
2. **Gate Opens:** If an object is detected within 50 cm, the gate opens (servo rotates to 90°).
3. **Visual Feedback:** The red LED turns off, blue LED turns on.
4. **Audible Feedback:** A buzzer beeps periodically while the gate is open.
5. **Gate Closes:** After 5 seconds of no object detected, the gate closes and indicators return to default.

## 🖥️ Code Overview

- `getDistance()` — Measures object distance using the ultrasonic sensor.
- `loop()` — Controls the gate, LEDs, and buzzer based on distance readings.
- `Servo` — Controls gate arm.
- `millis()` — Used to time the buzzer and gate auto-close delay.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Connect the components as per the pin definitions in the code.
2. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the board and test the gate system by placing an object in front of the sensor.
